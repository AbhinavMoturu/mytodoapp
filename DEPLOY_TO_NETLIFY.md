# Deploying Your To-Do List App to Netlify

## Step-by-Step Guide

### 1. Create a Netlify Account
Sign up for a free account at [netlify.com](https://netlify.com) using your email, GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket account.

### 2. Deploy Directly from Your Computer (Drag & Drop Method)

1. Go to the Netlify dashboard
2. Look for the deployment area (usually shows "Drag and drop your site folder here")
3. Open File Explorer and navigate to your project folder (`C:\Users\motur\Desktop\neeeeeewwwwww`)
4. Select all files in your project folder (index.html, script.js, style.css, etc.)
5. Drag and drop these files onto the Netlify deployment area
6. Wait for the upload and deployment to complete (usually takes less than a minute)

### 3. Access Your Online To-Do List
After deployment completes:

1. Netlify will assign a random subdomain to your site (e.g., `random-name-123456.netlify.app`)
2. Click on the site name to view your deployed to-do list application

### 4. Customize Your Site Name (Optional)

1. From your Netlify dashboard, select your new site
2. Go to "Site settings" → "Domain management" → "Custom domains"
3. Click "Options" next to your Netlify subdomain
4. Select "Edit site name"
5. Enter a custom name (e.g., `my-todo-app`)
6. Your site will now be available at `my-todo-app.netlify.app`

### 5. Bookmark for Daily Use

1. Open your Netlify site URL in your browser
2. Bookmark it or add to favorites
3. For mobile devices, add to home screen:
   - iOS: Share button → Add to Home Screen
   - Android: Menu → Add to Home Screen

## Important Notes

- Your to-do lists are stored in your browser's local storage
- Each device will have its own separate list of tasks
- Clearing browser data will erase your saved tasks

## Updating Your App

To update your app after making changes locally:

1. Go to your Netlify dashboard
2. Find your site and click on it
3. Go to the "Deploys" tab
4. Drag and drop your updated project folder onto the deployment area again

Netlify will deploy the new version of your app within seconds.

## Setting Up Continuous Deployment (Optional)

For more advanced usage, you can connect your GitHub repository to Netlify for automatic deployments:

1. Push your code to a GitHub repository
2. In Netlify, choose "New site from Git"
3. Select GitHub and authorize Netlify
4. Choose your repository
5. Configure build settings (not needed for this simple app)
6. Click "Deploy site"

With this setup, any changes pushed to your GitHub repository will automatically be deployed to your Netlify site.
